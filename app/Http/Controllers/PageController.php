    This PHP code snippet defines a controller class named `PageController` within a Laravel application. This class contains a single method, `show`, which is responsible for displaying a specific page based on its slug. Here's a breakdown of the code:

    ### Namespace and Imports

    ```php
    namespace App\Http\Controllers;

    use App\Models\Page;
    ```

    - The code resides in the `App\Http\Controllers` namespace, a standard location for controllers in a Laravel application.
    - It imports a model class `Page`, which presumably represents a page within the application's database.

    ### The `show` Method

    ```php
    public function show($id)
    {
        $page = Page::where('slug', $id)->firstOrFail();

        return view('pages.show', ['page' => $page]);
    }
    ```

    - The method accepts a parameter `$id`, which, despite the name, is intended to represent the slug of the page.
    - It performs a database query using Laravel's Eloquent ORM to retrieve the first `Page` object that matches the given slug. If no matching record is found, it throws a `ModelNotFoundException`, which Laravel will translate into a 404 Not Found HTTP response by default.
    - Finally, it returns a view named `pages.show`, passing the retrieved `$page` object to the view. This view is likely a Blade template that renders the content of the page.

    In summary, this `PageController` class provides functionality to display a specific page within a Laravel application, identified by its slug. The corresponding Blade template would be responsible for rendering the content of the page as HTML.
